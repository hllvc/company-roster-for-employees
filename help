 |	NAVIGATION THROUGH MENU:
 |
 |		* Navigate by provided character before ")" in any menu.
 |		* '0' is either for exit or going back
 |		* 'C' is for clearing Roster and 'h' for help
 |	 
 |	Some rules:
 |
 |		* JMBG must be exactly 13 character, can't contain letter, only digits
 |		* Your age can't be negative or over defined MAX_AGE
 |		* While updating employee details character/digit '0' represents default setting
 |			(only while updating you are able to set age as '0', but that means you don't want to change age)
 |		* Department field can contain multiple words while Name and Surname only one
 |		* You can't change your JMBG, if you would like to change delete old employee
 |				and create new one with new JMBG
 |		* You can clear Roster inside program with provided option
 |			(be aware only capital letter 'Y' is for confirming clearing)
 |		* Search employee option searches for all employees by provided Name or Surname,
 |			if you provide both it searches employees that match and name and surname
 |		* Only available option for deleting, updating employees is while you have listed ones
 |			(that is done by inputing JMBG as identification number, if there are more with same name)
